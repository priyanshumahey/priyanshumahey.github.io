## Overview

| [GitHub Link](https://github.com/priyanshumahey/RL-Project/tree/main) |

As part of my final project for Neuromatch Academy's [deep learning class](https://deeplearning.neuromatch.io/tutorials/intro.html).

## My Role and Responsibilities

For this project, my main responsibilities were in designing the neural network architecture, and in training the model. I collaborated with the team to set up the environment and to write the code for the model. For the physics environmnet, we used Pybullet and implemented OpenAI's gym package to train the model. I worked with both SAC and DDQN algorithms and wrote code to visualize the training process with Tensorboard.

## Langauges and Frameworks Used

This project was written in Python and made use of the following tools and libraries:

- Pybullet: open-source simulation software
- OpenAI Gym: toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms
- Tensorboard: visualization toolkit for machine learning experimentation
- PyTorch: open-source machine learning framework

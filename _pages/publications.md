My research interests are primarily in the area of applied machine learning, reinforcement learning and computational biology. Below is a list of conference presentations, published papers and current papers I'm working on!

Published Papers:
- Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for Simulating Electroencephalography, 2023 (Published)
- Communicating Branches Between the Musculocutaneous and Median Nerves in the Brachial Plexus, 2023 (In Publication Process)

Conference Presentations and Workshops:
- NURC: Deep Learning in Neuroscience Workshop, 2023
- MURC: Using Neural Networks to Detect Eye Corners in the Da Vinci Surgical Robot, 2021
- Indicium: Investigating the effects of the R621C mutation on the function of synphilin-1 and the interaction between synphilin-1 and alpha-synuclein using Danio Rerio, 2021

Current Papers and Projects:
- Transfer Reinforcement Learning From 2d to 3d for Bipedal Robotics (In Progress)
- Predicting Classification of Tumors of Unkown Origin Using Machine Learning (In Progress)
- Optomization of GANS for EEG Replication (In Progress)
- Control of Bipedal Robots Using Brain Computer Interfaces (In Progress)
- Prediction of Joystick Control Using EEG Brain Computer Interfaces (In Progress)
